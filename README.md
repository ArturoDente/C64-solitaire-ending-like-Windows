# C64-solitaire-ending-like-Windows
It reproduces the falling cards effect of the ending sequence in the Windows solitaire, for commodore 64

The "scrensaver" is just a little demo inspired on the windows solitaire game's ending, when the cards jump over the screen.
It's made using Carlo and Lorenzo's Barazzetta card lib.
To launch it just execute "start" program.
Warp mode strongly recommended if available!
